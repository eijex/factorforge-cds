## Current Release Status

FactorForge v3.5.1 extends the web/API product line with versioned Sequence
Policy Profiles (internally retained as `SopProfile` for compatibility), an
editable browser-local policy workflow, Top-K discovery slates,
an explicit DP v2.1.1 path, constrained-sLLM research integration, and adaptive
partial-DP rescue while retaining stable DP v2 as the default. The preceding v3.4.5 release
completed the interface-reliability patch line: browser
interactions were restored, release checks were strengthened, and product,
API, engine, registry, documentation, and fixture version surfaces were
synchronized. The supported public boundary remains deterministic in-silico
CDS design and pre-synthesis sequence review. sLLM Gen 3 remains a separate,
feature-gated research preview and does not imply a trained production model or
biological validation. The v3.5.1 Git tag and package publication remain pending.

DP v2.1.1 (`2.1.1`) is the current explicit Gen 2 research candidate.
It adds a 45-nt initiation-GC active layer and >=6-nt homopolymer automaton
guard without adding a DP state dimension. Target-mAb-A calibration is complete;
the frozen 36-protein holdout gate remains pending, so stable DP v2 `2.0.1`
continues as the default feasibility path.

Current maintenance and evidence priorities are:

- Public surface wording audit across README, docs, web UI, package metadata, Docker/GHCR references, and citation archives
- Wet-lab feedback review and public-safe validation summaries
- Raw-sequence logging and benchmark-summary leakage checks
- Codon-usage table provenance notes and checksums for public datasets
- Bug fixes and metric corrections based on community reports
- Documentation improvements

---

## Future — Algorithm Depth (version TBD)

> Not part of the released v3.3.0. v3.3.0 shipped reference-policy guardrails,
> production codon-reference activation (NbeV1.1), and related evidence-field
> additions — see [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md). The items below remain planned
> for a future release once scheduled.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **tAI support** | tRNA Adaptation Index as alternative/complement to CAI |
| **5' UTR mRNA folding** | Optional MFE-aware review around the start codon when dependencies are available |
| **Codon pair bias** | Detection and adjustment of unfavorable adjacent codon pairs |
| **Kozak context** | Optimization of nucleotides flanking the ATG (-3, +4 positions) |

> **Extended DP engine** (DP feasibility parameters exposed via CLI and
> API) shipped — see [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Removed from the table
> above; it is no longer a planned item.

## v3.4 — CDS Design Review

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DNA/CDS semantic workflow** | Classify DNA/CDS separately from protein input; preserve translated protein and nucleotide length during synonymous redesign |
| **Acceptance criteria** | Required / Preferred / Ignored controls for CAI, global/local GC, Type IIS, repeats, homopolymers, and forbidden motifs |
| **Automated decision** | Deterministic PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL with candidate-level QC matrix |
| **Reviewer disposition** | Record human accept, exception, redesign, or reject decisions without overwriting automated results |
| **Review provenance** | Versioned criteria snapshots, result identifiers, decision history, and reproducible design metadata |

> This release remains an in-silico CDS design and pre-synthesis review workflow. It does not claim expression, yield, synthesis acceptance, or experimental validation.

## Future — Protein Type Expansion (version TBD)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Membrane protein profile** | TMD detection; local codon-usage review around transmembrane domains |
| **Secreted protein profile** | Signal peptide recognition; separate optimization of SP region; detection of tandem/duplicated signal peptides |
| **Chloroplast-targeted profile** | Transit peptide-aware optimization |
| **PTGS silencing risk** | Flag sequences with similarity to plant endogenous genes |

## v3.5 — Multi-Engine Version Governance and Sequence Policy Profiles *(web/API deployed)*

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gen 1 — Rule** | Stable profile engine, independently versioned as 1.x |
| **Gen 2 — DP v2** | Exact GC-state and configured-motif automaton constraints, independently versioned as 2.x |
| **Gen 2 — DP v2.1.1** | Explicit local-composition development candidate; calibration complete, 36-protein holdout pending |
| **Gen 3 — sLLM Hybrid** | Feature-gated 0.x research preview; no trained production-model claim |
| **Version manifest** | One machine-readable product/engine source of truth exposed by the API |
| **Sequence Policy Profiles** | Upload-first versioned review-policy examples with YAML export, YAML/JSON browser-local upload, persistence, reset, provenance, and collapsed manual overrides. FactorForge applies user-defined policy; it does not define, approve, or validate a laboratory SOP. |

## Future — Validation-Driven Activation (version TBD)

- Activate 5' ramp, viral-delivery, or tissue-specific profiles only after reviewed evidence supports each capability.

---

## v3.6 — Host Expansion

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Insect host profiles (Sf9, Tni)** | Baculovirus/BEVS host-context research and codon-source review |
| **Additional plant hosts** | Arabidopsis, tomato, Lemna, Wolffia globosa |
| **Documentation finalized** | Final docs pass |

---

## v3.7 — Release Readiness

- Full API docstring coverage
- Reproducible benchmark scripts
- Extended tutorial
- State-of-the-field comparison plan (JCat, OPTIMIZER, Codon Harmonizer, IDT) using documented, reproducible metrics only

---

## v3.8 — Stable Release

- All profiles have documented validation status; experimental profiles remain gated unless reviewed evidence supports activation
- Full documentation audit
- Final polish

---

## Future — Trained ML Engine *(version TBD; data-conditional)*

No public ML engine is scheduled until sufficient, non-confidential validation data and benchmark evidence are available.

- ML engine exposed only after compatibility, cost, reproducibility, and claim-boundary review
- Training pipeline based on curated, non-confidential wet-lab validation summaries
- Rule-based vs ML benchmark comparison using documented public metrics
- No committed timeline — depends on wet-lab data accumulation

---

## Product Roadmap Themes *(claim-bounded)*

Beyond version-bound engineering work, FactorForge is being shaped as a pre-synthesis review harness for plant CDS design workflows. The product journey builds on the paper/research-software track: reproducible in-silico candidate generation first, then broader review artifacts for synthesis, cloning, and experimental planning.

- **Experimental speed** — deterministic assembly checks, sequence-complexity warnings, multi-gene assembly review, and reproducible design packages.
- **Production-quality review** — host/profile maturity labels and quality-risk-aware design annotations for expert review.
- **Regulatory and safety boundaries** — privacy-aware review workflows, local-first safety screening hooks, and public-safe feedback processes.

These themes are intended to improve reviewability and reproducibility. They do not guarantee expression, glycosylation, folding, yield, synthesis acceptance, biosecurity compliance, regulatory approval, or downstream biological performance.

---

## Wet-lab Validation *(ongoing — not version-bound)*

Wet-lab validation is an ongoing, open-ended process independent of software versioning.
Public-safe summaries may be tracked as GitHub Issues under the [Wet-lab Validation](https://github.com/eijex/factorforge-cds/milestone/9) milestone. Private or sensitive feedback should not be submitted through public GitHub Issues.

- Submit only public-safe, non-confidential summaries via public [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/eijex/factorforge-cds/issues/new?template=wet_lab_result.yml). Send sensitive or private summaries by email instead.
- See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for submission format and current status

## Out of Scope

- Animal or clinical expression systems
- Protein structure prediction (use AlphaFold / ESMFold directly)
- CDS design for microbial hosts (E. coli, yeast)
