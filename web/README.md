## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Open in browser
open index.html

# Or use a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
# Copy files to gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages
cp -r web/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy frontend"
git push origin gh-pages

# Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
# Settings → Pages → Source: gh-pages branch
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Endpoint

Edit `js/app.js` line 3:

```javascript
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://factorforge.eijex.com/api/optimize';
```

## 🎨 Features

- ✅ Custom restriction site input and removal report
- ✅ Optional reproducibility seed and Type IIS enzyme presets
- ✅ Progressive disclosure for alternative objectives and expert settings
- ✅ Capability-gated DP v2.1 2.1.0-dev three-axis development candidate;
  stable DP v2 2.0.1 remains the default feasibility path

  next actions, requested-vs-applied settings, detailed checks, candidate
  comparison, reproducibility provenance, and standalone print-friendly HTML
  that preserves the light or dark theme selected at download time

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Researcher design-review workflow

The desktop screen is a three-column workbench: sequence input, a compact Design
Brief, and Design Review. All three columns follow the same document scroll so a
shorter column does not appear frozen while a longer result is reviewed. The brief
exposes the expression host, recommended deterministic method, and applied
requirements. Optional sequence, assembly, and review-policy controls retain
their existing API semantics through progressive disclosure. Unavailable
execution modes, disabled objectives, and immutable reference policy are
excluded from the primary path. After a successful run, the same review column
shows computational checks, candidate evidence, sequence output, and downloads.

The Researcher Decision Report uses the API-provided `automated_decision`,
`decision_summary`, and acceptance-criteria rows as its authority; the browser
does not create a separate CAI or GC pass/fail rule. It leads with a decision
brief, translates non-passing checks into bounded review actions, and compares
requested settings with the API-recorded effective settings. Missing and
uncomputed values remain explicit rather than being displayed as zero. New
local-history entries retain the report snapshot and provenance without retaining
the raw input sequence. The evidence-record JSON omits raw input and output
sequences by design; the standalone HTML includes the optimized sequence and
displays a sequence-data handling notice.
The standalone report preserves the app theme selected when the file is
downloaded, while print output remains light for legibility.

The experimental comparison panel displays missing or invalid metrics as
`Not evaluated`. AA identity uses an explicit numeric `aa_identity` fraction;
responses without it cannot display a pass. Type IIS clearance requires an
explicit Boolean result, and conflicting site counts do not display as clean.
ML preview and database controls remain gated by deployment capabilities.
